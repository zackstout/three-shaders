# Shaders with Three.js

This repo tracks my early progress working with shaders in Three.js.

I owe a lot to the [Three.js journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by Bruno Simon, and also to [Yuri Artiukh](https://www.youtube.com/@akella_) for teaching me almost everything I know about shaders.

I love making generative art, and exploring the place where math commingles with art. Shaders have turned out to be a great medium for exploring that.

I am fascinated by patterns that occur in the natural world, and trying to capture and recreate them with computer graphics and math.

## Screenshots
